<p>Exploratory Sunday is a social awareness campaign initiated by StatDevs. We post weekly statistics and visualizations every Sunday concentrating on Pakistan's demographic, healthcare and socio-economic indicators. The salient feature of these posts is to showcase how Pakistan's conditions stack up against Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
