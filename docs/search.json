    "title": "Hello World : Introducing Spatial Data",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Why use R for Spatial Analysis\nFor over 20 years, R community has developed number of R packages for handling and analysing spatial data. Upto 2003, these packages used to make different assumptions about how spatial data were organised. After some joint effort, the community developers wrote R package sp which extends base R classes and methods for spatial data. Classes specify a structure and define how spatial data is organized and stored while Methods are instances of functions specialised for particular class. Due to sp package, R community got enhanced tools for understanding Spatial data. Therefore, for our blog series we will use sp package and understand the different methods and classes of it.\n\n\nWhat is GIS\nSpatial data storage and analysis is traditionally done in Geographical Information System (GIS). According to Burrough and McDonnell (1998) a GIS is ‘. . . a powerful set of tools for collecting, storing, retrieving at will, transforming, and displaying spatial data from the real world for a particular set of purposes’.\nFor many spatial projects, using GIS is enough for the project requirements, but R makes a good choice for spatial data because of its capability in data analysis and visualization. Now a days R scripts are used with GIS software and possibly GIS database as well.\n\n\nTypes of Spatial Data\nBefore we move to spatial analysis and its equivalent classes, we must be clear in types of Spatial Data types. A broad understanding of spatial data by Roger S. Bivand (2013) is as follows:\nSpatial data have spatial reference : they have coordinate values and a system of reference for these coordinates.\nAs a simple example, we are interested in the volcanoes that have shown activity between 1980 and 2000. We could list the locations of these volcanoes as pairs of longitude/latitude decimal degree values with respect to the prime meridian at Greenwich and zero latitude at the equator.\nIf we also have the magnitude of the last observed eruption at the volcano this information is called as Non spatial attribute:\nA non spatial entity but the information will exist for each spatial entity (volcano).\nThe non spatial attributes are utilized for characterizing the non spatial features of the object. Other similar examples for non spatial attributes would be population of the city and unemployment rate in the city.\nIt is important to understand that without such explicit spatial attributes, points in the map have implicit attributes. The implicit attributes are also known as Spatial attributes. We represent such spatial information of entities by data models. The different types of different data models are as follows defined in Roger S. Bivand (2013):\nPoint:   a single point location, such as a GPS reading or a geocoded address.\nLine:   a set of ordered points, connected by straight line segments.\nPolygon:   an area, marked by one or more enclosing lines, possibly containing holes.\nGrid:   a collection of points or rectangular cells, organized in regular lattice.\nPoint, line and Polygon are vector data models and represented entities as closely as possible, while Grid is a rastar data model representing continuous surfaces using regular tessellation (pattern of shapes that fit together perfectly.)\n\n\nEnding Remarks\nSpatial Data Mining is a huge field which helps us analyze how certain variables geographically impact our lives. Why certain spatial relationships exist? Why are certain locations popular travel destinations? Why does a brand do successfully in one country and not in another?\nIn this article, I explained fundamental blocks of spatial analysis including the spatial and non spatial attributes. Next week, we will dive in exploring Points which form a fundamental component of maps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBurrough, P. A., and R. A. McDonnell. 1998. Principles of Geographical Information Systems. Oxford University Press.\n\n\nRoger S. Bivand, Virgilio Gómez-Rubio, Edzer Pebesma. 2013. Applied Spatial Data Analysis with r. Springer New York, NY."
