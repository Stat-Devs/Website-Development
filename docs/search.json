    "section": "",
    "text": "Winter season is upon us, and with it comes the smog. Pakistan and South Asia as a whole, continuously ranked lowest in air quality indices. Air pollution causes millions of deaths every year according to WHO. Unlike developed countries, the resources required to adequately monitor factors contributing to air quality are scarce. Even in developed countries like the USA, these monitors are mainly concentrated in major cities.\nTo counter this limitation, the HAQAST (Nasa Health And Air Quality Applied Sciences Team), part of the NASA Applied Sciences Program aims to connect earth science experts and NASA Satellite data to solve prevalent issues related to health, environment degradation, air quality etc.\nAlthough satellite data cannot be a true replacement for on-ground measurements, it is a suitable alternative for countries like Pakistan where resources to install on-ground monitors is severely limited. The NASA satellite data is a treasure trove for earth science researchers to try and put forward solutions to the air quality problem that the country is currently facing.\nFor instance, the following time series plot was created using data from NASA’s global nitrogen dioxide monitoring homepage. In this data, the organization has provided daily median nitrogen presence in the troposphere (lowest layer of the earth’s atmosphere). It can be clearly seen in this graph that Nitrogen Dioxide presence peaks between October and December. This is because the stubble burning process takes place in these months, where farmers burn the residuals after harvesting crops.\nWhile this is common knowledge that stubble burning is a major contributor to smog, these types of analysis are a step towards solving the issue as they help specify the problem quantitatively. Subsequently, whatever solution is implemented to curtail air pollution, benchmarks could be identified and monitored to track progress. This ultimately help policy makers make informed policies.\n\n\n\nReference\n\n\nLamsal, L. N., Krotkov, N.

What are the benchmarks set by SDG and how is Pakistan performing? We conducted a collaborative study with the help of Indus Hospital & Health Networks and Sifat Associates to provide a broad understanding of health deficiencies experienced by Most Disadvantaged Districts (MDDs) in Pakistan.\n\n\n\n Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfant Mortality Modelling\n\n\nThe MDG target for Infant Mortality was 40 per 1000 live births while Pakistan stood at 62 per 1000 live births. We analyzed the causes of Infant Mortality in Pakistan and why Pakistan is lagging behind ? Are there demographic variations or mother’s social and health factors? We developed and deployed a Machine learning model for infant’s survival chances based on PDHS 2017-2018 data.\n\n\n\n Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClustering Countries\n\n\nWe analyzed data of countries based on their socio-economic and health indicators.

This interactive shiny application helps explore injury patterns.\n\n\n\n Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPredictive Modelling\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct Recommendation\n\n\nAnalyzing past customer behavior helps sellers push relevant recomendations to consumers. We studied data of past purchases of customers of an online retail store. We then implemented a product recommendation system based on association rule mining technique.\n\n\n\n Learn More\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStock Volatility Forecasting\n\n\nWith successful volatility model, we can gain insights about future market behavior over time and can spot trends which make investors align their portfolios with the associated expected returns.
