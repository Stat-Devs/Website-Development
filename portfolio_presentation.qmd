# Macro Analysis & Research {background-image="images/portfolio/title.png"}

## Macro Analysis of Pakistan Health Sector {#health}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
#### Problem Statement

To create a broad understanding of health deficiencies experienced by Pakistan population and identify Most Disadvantaged Districts (MDDs) in Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan.

#### Project Execution

*Data Sets:* [Census 2017, Pakistan Social Living Measurement Survey (PSLM) 2019-2020, Pakistan Maternal Mortality Survey (PMMS) 2019, Pakistan Demographic & Health Survey 2017-2018 (PDHS), Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) 2018-19](https://www.pbs.gov.pk/publication/household-integrated-economic-survey-hies-2018-19)

-   Analyzed and explored the exact status of Public Health Care Delivery (PHC) at country and provincial levels.

-   Summarized and presented the current status of health parameters in mortality, prevalence and disease incidence in Pakistan and compared with peer countries like Bangladesh, India, Srilanka and others.

-   Explored Pakistan Demographics and statistically selected Most Disadvantaged Districts (MDDs) on basis of PHC Delivery, Social Living Measurement (SLM) and Burden of Disease (BOD) indicators.

-   Analyzed Quintile Wise Health and Non Health Expenditure Analysis by provinces.

-   Suggested the Intervention Plan to deliver PHC to these MDDs through Mobile PHC units.

## Infant Mortality Modelling {#infant}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
#### Problem Statement

To predict the infant mortality and infant's survival chances in Pakistan.

#### Project Execution and Results

*Data Sets:* [Pakistan Demographic & Health Survey 2017-2018 (PDHS)](https://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR354/FR354.pdf)

-   Developed and Deployed data Application to train classification models predicting the chances of infant survival based on Demographic, Health & Social factors.

-   Novel idea to develop infant mortality predictions using demographic and health survey data as previous works involved use of health cards.

-   Applied data cleaning, feature selection and machine learning algorithms such as Neural Networks to analyze the social and demographic factors of infants such as previous birth history, infant's height and weight and family wealth index.
