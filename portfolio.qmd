National Electronic Injury Surveillance Data Exploration

</h5>

<p class="card-text">Injuries, like diseases, do not occur at random. Some population groups are at increased risk of injury because of greater exposure to hazards, decreased ability to avoid hazards, or decreased resistance to injury, and some groups have a lower likelihood of complete recovery or survival once injured. We develop an interactive shiny application for exploring injury patterns and explores the rate of injuries per 10,000 people based on gender. It explores the incidence of injury based on location, body part and hospital's diagnostics.<b> Learn more...</b></p>
